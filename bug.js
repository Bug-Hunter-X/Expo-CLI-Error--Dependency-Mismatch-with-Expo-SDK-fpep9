This error occurs when using Expo CLI and involves a mismatch between the project's dependencies and the Expo SDK version.  It typically manifests as an unexpected build failure or runtime error related to missing modules or incompatible APIs.  The root cause often lies in outdated package versions or incorrect configuration in `package.json` or `app.json`. For instance, using a React Native library that isn't compatible with the Expo SDK version can trigger this.
